The goal is to replicate this from scratch, applying the CSS and HTML skills I have learnt.

# Personal journey
-Made the mistake of not linking the CSS file in the HTML file, which results in CSS not being applied.
-Google's inspect webpage tool is extremly powerful for seeing every div's square and thus knowing how to align them and how to flex them. 
-Flexing is extremly powerful and can be constantly spammed everywhere!
-Border Radius for buttons give it rounded edges!
-Calling nested HTML from CSS requires a spacing! For example, if you have a "p" child in a "div" child in a class called "class1", in CSS you will type .class1 div p, not .class1.div.p. <---- this is for an element having multiple class names like class = "class1 class2 class3".


# What i think i need to work on

I noticed that my page is not very "responsive" per say. If i shrink the webpage, the images are stubborn and do not adjust position or size, and some text can be in awkward positions when i shrink the webpage. This is one part i need to improve on, as this means my website is not cross platform compatible.
